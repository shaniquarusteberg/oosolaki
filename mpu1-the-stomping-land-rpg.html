Hey everyone! I have noticed a lot of questions around here regarding the new NES Mini - ranging from the games to the equipment to the standard, "should I buy?" So i decided to take some time to put together a guide that I hope covers most of the questions everyone would have. My hope is that this will give you some new information to the NES Mini or help you decide if you should buy it. Be aware, this is going to be a wall of text. If for some reason you did not know the NES Classic.

From my research, this genre was heralded by - The Oregon Trail But particularly: - Survival Island (1983). Technically, this game isn't by Hideo Kojima, but unlike other Metal Gear spinoffs, this one does have MGS in the title and its' status as canon or uncanon remain in the air.

In most RPGs, dinosaurs (and other, related creatures) have three major roles- short murderous thing, big murderous thing, and setpiece. Here's a few quick ideas on how to use realistic dinosaurs in your RPGs! For most dinosaurs- as well as related creatures, such as pterosaurs- the sounds they make will not be birdlike tweeting or mammalian roars and yowls. Most can be described as a cross between a crocodile and a bird of prey- screeches, hisses, jaw-snapping and rumbling. 
Hello Internet, I've written a short story based on the Warhammer 40,000 RPG, Dark Heresy. I love the game and all of it's intracacies and got inspired to write something based in the universe.

My cousin Larry saw it too. We were both huuuuge video gamers who would still play Atari2600 up until the c64 was bought for us and we knew big things were coming. No joke, we played atari2600 as if progaming would be a thing someday. Anyway, we both knew this SMB thing was huge, and pleaded with our parents in Hills dept store for lots of quarters. We're not the only ones who thought this game was big, it has proven. Hey all, in the second installment of this series we'll be looking at the rebel group campaign players will know from Wings of Liberty, but has actually been around through the entire franchise.
